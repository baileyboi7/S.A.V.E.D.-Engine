 Secure Agile Vested Extensible Development (S.A.V.E.D) will serve as the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) for open-source collaborative innovation utilizing the existing Block-Chain network established by "Stellar". The Stellar Development Foundation (SDF)'s framework provides extremely unique, inherent instances of modularity.  This potential beautifully leverages the functional power of procedural Block-Chain.  This allows the dynamics of modular innovation to compensate for the inevitable point of diminishing returns.  S.A.V.E.D will utilize the  expansive open-source cryptographic framework in place to create innovative composability.  There are dozens of use-cases I have personally conceptualized that could provide beneficial advancements in terms of cost and efficiency in nearly any area of our lives. This synergizes in a mesmerizing way with Stellar FinTech, Stellar Aid, and Stellar Tokenization.  S.A.V.E.D will begin with two concurrent use cases that share its name.  S.A.V.E.D is still just an embryonic SDLC at this point in time.  As each of us started as two separate  cells which comprised a greater being wonderfully made, so to shall She.  We will being with two additional patents that will exist under the patent of this main engine.  I fear the engine and our first two use-cases are, by necessity and nature, quite non-provisional.  As the amazing people who have already built so many wonderful components of Stellar, offer their intrinsic and hard earned knowledge to this open-source dream, it may become something entirely different than what I conceive.  As for now, it will just be me.  I hope this is detailed enough to protect what could be  (is) the most important and hopefully globally beneficial thing I will ever do, I felt I needed to do at least this much to try and protect it.  It began as an entirely different Engine, Frame, (F.R.AE.M) building off of a strange mix of different libraries in what was essentially an IDE.  But, it allowed the use of C++ coding however you could script it in while simultaneously allowing for deployment across 5 different platforms simultaneously.  Shall I begin?  Thanks for listening.  Oh great!   I guess I will dive RIGHT INTO REGEX ON GITHUB THEN, FREEPATENTSONLINE.COM!  I'm glad i was able to copy-pasta this right into the github psudoCode branch whew,  This is legal my provisional patent in progress, and I will be calling the closest patent office around here today.  So don;t get any funny ideas!  KEK LUL :D
